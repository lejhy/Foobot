# Foobot
S small program I hacked together for a friend of mine. It sends a GET request to a foobot.io server based on the specifications and retrieves the the appropriate JSON with sensor data. The JSON is then converted to a CSV file. The process creates a new column with time converted to a human readable format and as well checks for missing entries, where it inserts a blank line with only time data.
